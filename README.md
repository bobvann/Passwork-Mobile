# Passwork-Mobile

Unofficial Passwork (https://passwork.me) mobile application.
Developed using Apache Cordova, supporting all platforms.
Tested on (for the moment) iOS and Android.

Builders and tester for other platforms are welcome!

## API
Passwork-Mobile is built using official APIs (https://passwork.me/info/api/) and official Javascript Connector.

## Features

As APIs are currently read-only, we could not realize an app which saves passwords to your Passwork account.
So what we currently support is:
- Passwords storage
- Copy to clipboard feature
- Protect the app with a Passcode
- (iOS only), use the Touch ID instead of passcode.
